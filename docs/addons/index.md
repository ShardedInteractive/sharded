Sharded Addons are **3rd party extensions** that integrate with Sharded Services and API while adding more commands, 
extended logic, and customization options. 

!!! question "What are the difference between Addons and Cogs?"
    Addons are **not officially** supported by **Sharded Interactive** thus allowing for 3rd party developers to create their own
    addons without worrying about our security and code guidelines.

    Cogs are **officially** supported by **Sharded Interactive** which follows out security and code guidelines and don't have to worry
    about potential security flaws or concerns with 3rd party addons.

??? warning "Potential security risks or performance issues with Sharded Addons"
    Individual addons developed by **3rd party developers** can potentially contain security risks or performance issues about Sharded systems. 
    If you're worried about those risks then look for **'Sharded Approved'** when downloading addons.
