:::note Self-Hosted or Managed Instance?
Depending on what license you got for your server / business, certain documentation won't apply to you. If the page or section only had <span class="badge badge--primary">Enterprise</span> then it applies to both unless specified.

Have any comment, questions, or concern? Please contact your agent specified in the email.

:::info Documentation for Self-Hosted licenses
Most documentation is built for community self-hosted version of sharded however, enterprise documentation will include specific documentation for features only available with a valid license. If you cannot find the documentation you're looking for here in the enterprise docs, please have a look in the community version. If no documentation cannot be found, contact your agent.
